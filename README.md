# Expenses-Calculator

This is an "expenses" calculator I made using Python. First you provide it with a total amount. Then you give it a text file path which contains your monthly expenses. Then it uses simple maths to calculate your spent money and remaining money.
Special feature: can skip integer that comes after the name of a month for example "March 2023". The 2023 will be skipped from the expenses calculation.
